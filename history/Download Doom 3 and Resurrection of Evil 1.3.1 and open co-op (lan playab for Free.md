The files are compressed in ZIP format, so you will need a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip to extract them. Once you have extracted the files, you will see two folders: one named "open\_coop" and one named "open\_coop\_roe". These are the mod folders that you need to copy to your Doom 3 installation directory.
 
## Step 2: Install the Open Co-op Mod
 
The next step is to install the Open Co-op mod by copying the mod folders to your Doom 3 installation directory. The default location of this directory is C:\Program Files (x86)\Doom 3, but it may vary depending on where you installed the game. You can also right-click on the game icon and select "Open file location" to find it.
 
Once you have located your Doom 3 installation directory, simply copy and paste the "open\_coop" folder into it. If you have Resurrection of Evil installed, do the same with the "open\_coop\_roe" folder. You should now see two new options in your Doom 3 main menu: "Open Co-op" and "Open Co-op ROE". These are the mod launchers that you need to use to play the games in co-op mode.
 
## Step 3: Configure the Open Co-op Mod Settings
 
The final step is to configure the Open Co-op mod settings according to your preferences and network conditions. To do this, launch the mod from the Doom 3 main menu and select "Options". You will see a list of categories that you can customize, such as "Gameplay", "Network", "Sound", "Video", and more.
 
Some of the most important settings that you should adjust are:
 
- **Gameplay:** Here you can change the difficulty level, the number of players, the friendly fire option, the respawn mode, and more.
- **Network:** Here you can set up your server name, password, port, bandwidth, and more. You can also enable or disable voice chat and text chat.
- **Sound:** Here you can adjust the volume levels, the sound quality, and the sound effects.
- **Video:** Here you can tweak the graphics settings, such as resolution, brightness, gamma, anti-aliasing, and more.

You can also access these settings during gameplay by pressing ESC and selecting "Options". Once you are satisfied with your settings, click "Apply" and then "OK" to save them.
 
## Step 4: Start or Join a Co-op Game
 
You are now ready to start or join a co-op game with your friends. To start a co-op game, select "New Game" from the mod menu and choose your desired map. You can also select "Load Game" if you want to resume a previous co-op game. To join a co-op game, select
